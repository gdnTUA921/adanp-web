##  Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   PHP (v7.4+)
*   MySQL/MariaDB (via XAMPP, WAMP, or standalone)

### 1. Database Setup
1.  Create a database named `adanp_portal` in your MySQL server.
2.  Import `frontend/database_schema.sql` into the database.
3.  Configure `config/Database.php` with your local database credentials.

### 2. Backend Configuration
1.  Ensure your PHP server is running (e.g., Apache via XAMPP).
2.  The backend expects to be served from a local server (defaulted to `http://localhost`).

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
